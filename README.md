Subject: Now Live: Rahona Power BI Central is Available in French! / Maintenant en direct : Rahona Power BI Central est disponible en français !
Body:
Hello Team,
Power BI continues to grow in Rahona.
A few months ago, we released the English version of our Center of Excellence to support your analytics journey. Today, we are proud to announce the next step in our evolution: The Rahona Power BI Center of Excellence (CoE) is now fully available in French.
We are excited to extend access to support more teams in their PBI onboarding journey, ensuring that our Francophone colleagues have the same seamless experience.
What is available in the French version?
Just like the English site, the localized version of Rahona Power BI Central is your one-stop destination for resources, access, and support. You can now access the following in French:
• Self-Serve Content & Documentation: Comprehensive guides on how to connect Power BI Desktop with Rahona AZs using your VDI and how to access data across the Rahona Ecosystem.
• Self-Publishing Guidelines: Step-by-step instructions on the Self-publish process to share reports and collaborate within your team using Power BI Premium Capacity.
• Onboarding Resources: Access the Rahona Power BI New User Onboarding Guide and learn the required service requests and intake forms.
• Governance & Best Practices: Learn how to access up to confidential & below data securely.
How to Access:
Visit Rahona Power BI Central [Link] and toggle the language to French to explore the new site.
Support & Training:
Our support channels remain open for everyone. You can still engage with the CoE team for troubleshooting through our mailbox or join our Office Hours for personalized guidance.
Let’s build the future of business intelligence together!
Regards,
Rahona Power BI Centre of Excellence (CoE)
